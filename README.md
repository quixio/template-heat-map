# Clickstream Analytics Template

This is a template application which displays realtime data analytics of customer activity on a website. The pink boxes show which products have the most attention at that point.

The pipeline collects data from a fictional e-commerce web page and aggregates all users' mouse coordinates to produce a heat map with the data gathered four times a second. The heatmap is then overlayed on the original site for admins to see a vizualisation of the 'hottest' areas on each page.
